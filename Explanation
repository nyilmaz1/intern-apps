Dataset includes crimes in the City of Los Angeles from 2010 to March 20, 2018. 


With my analysis, I answered the following questions:

1.	In which day of the week was crime reported the most?
2.	In which time group (time grouped in 4 hour intervals) has crime been occurred the most?
3.	In which area ID has crime been reported the most?
4.	What kind of crime occurred the most?
5.	What is the victim age average and which age group is victimized the most?
6.	Which gender is victimized the most?
7.	Which descent is victimized the most?
8.	What type of structure, vehicle, or location did the crime take place?
9.	Which weapon is used the most?
10.	What are the top 3 locations in crime?
